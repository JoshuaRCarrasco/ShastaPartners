        <p id="biggertext">"Greg did an outstanding job advising us on the growth equity investment and project debt funding led by Balance Point Capital. We leveraged Greg's expansive network of private equity investors to find the right fit with Balance Point Capital. The financing included a project debt funding component which added an element of complexity to the transaction. Shasta was up for the challenge and we could not be happier with the outcome. I have relied upon Greg's insights and advice for over 15 years and have worked side-by-side with him on multiple transactions. I would recommend Greg highly and look forward to partnering with the team at Shasta Partners again in the future."</p>
